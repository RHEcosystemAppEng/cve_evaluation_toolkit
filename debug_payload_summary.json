    "metric_name": "SUMMARY_QUALITY",
    "metric_score": "0.8",
    "metric_reasoning": "The response adheres to the required structure, starting with an explicit verdict statement and being 3-5 sentences long. The verdict accurately reflects the investigation findings, stating that the CVE is exploitable. The response also cites specific technical details, such as the use of PQescapeLiteral() and PQexec/PQexecParams functions, which are traceable to the investigation results. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific evidence from the investigation results to support the verdict."
